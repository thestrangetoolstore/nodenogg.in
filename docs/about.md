nodenogg.in was invented by Dr. Adam Procter and has been initially build in conjunction with staff and students at Winchester School of Art. The version that you can now download, or find hosted at https://nodenogg.in was initially developed by Toby Milner-Gulland with guidance from Dr. Adam Procter. Initial prototypes and software developed during Procter's PhD is no longer online (mainly to reduce confusion)
