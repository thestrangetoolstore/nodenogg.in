nodenogg.in was invented and created by Dr. Adam Procter and was initially built in conjunction with staff and students at Winchester School of Art. The version that you can now download, or find hosted at https://nodenogg.in was developed by Toby Milner-Gulland with guidance from Dr. Adam Procter. Initial prototypes and software developed during Dr. Procter's PhD are no longer online (mainly to reduce confusion)

 nodenogg.in https://nodenogg.in is part of [The Strange Tool Store](https://strangetool.store) -
