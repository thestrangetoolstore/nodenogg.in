nodenogg.in was invented and created by Dr. Adam Procter and was initially built in conjunction with staff and students at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton. The version that you can now [download now](https://github.com/thestrangetoolstore/nodenogg.in), or find hosted at https://nodenogg.in was developed by Toby Milner-Gulland with guidance from Dr. Adam Procter. Initial prototypes and software developed during Dr. Procter's PhD are no longer online (mainly to reduce confusion).

nodenogg.in https://nodenogg.in is part of [The Strange Tool Store](https://strangetool.store)

## Dr Adam Procter

Dr. Adam Procter is a Principal Teaching Fellow of Games and Interaction Design at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton. He leads the BA (Hons) Games Design & Art programme within the Department of Art and Media Technology.

Adam’s research and practice focus on the creation and application of playful technology and games to stimulate thought, debate, and encourage thinking through making within Communities of Practice. Adam develops playful digital tools designed to enhance critical practice and teamwork.

These tools augment in-person, studio-based activities such as critiques, discussion groups, and ideation sessions, aiming to increase participation and engagement.

In his game-specific practice, Adam creates small satirical ecogames that comment on the climate crisis and public infrastructure failings. Recently, he has been designing games specifically for the Playdate, utilising its unique crank interface.

## Toby Milner-Gulland

Toby Milner-Gulland is fascinated by the endless challenge of how to nurture innovation, imagination and invention.

In practice, that means Toby has spent the last 10 years building tools, systems, teams and cultures.

Toby has worked on a wide range of different types of design, from installations, to operating systems, to TV interfaces, to XR headsets, films and white papers. A large part of my work is under NDA, but the projects on this site give a good impression of what I've done.

Towards the end of 2023, Toby took a year out to spend time with my family. In 2024 Toby has been slowly building a small independent practice called Figure.

From 2018–2023 Toby was Director of Creative Technology at Moving Brands Labs, which was a broad multidiscplinary role leading design, strategy and technology.Toby was part of a team that started and spun out Labs as an R&D consultancy back in 2015.

During that time, the team helped businesses push forward big new ideas through a combination of strategy, design and prototyping. We worked across disciplines, but specialised in spatial computing.

Toby learned a huge amount during that time. One lesson that stands out in particular is that if you stay curious, open-minded and optimistic, you can achieve pretty much anything.

Toby has with a wide range of clients, including: Adobe, Aoyama Treehouse, Apple, BBC, BBC Research & Development, Brightdrop, Canoo, Flex, Google AR+VR, Magic Leap, Meta, Mercedes F1, Microsoft, Nike, Samsung R&D, Trinity, Unilever, the United Nations and the University of Southampton.
