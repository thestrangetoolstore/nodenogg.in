# FAQs
Welcome, these FAQs focus on some of the nuances due to nodenogg.in being a peer to peer, decentralised technology, especially related to the data you create.

## Q: I created a microcosm but when another person visited they didn't see any of the nodes I had already added?

### Answers
- You can only see other peoples nodes in the Spatial view so make sure to check there first.
- second both you and anyone else that wants to sync data need to be visiting the top level domain of nodenogg.in aka where the app is running for example https://nodenogg.in

## Q: I deleted my nodes but another person showed me that they could still see them?

### Answers
- If you are not online at visiting the top level domain of nodenogg.in aka where the app is running for example https://nodenogg.in at the same time as other people whom you where in a microcosm with they nodes wont delete until they sync, aka you are both on nodenogg.in at the same time


## Q: I cant find the microcosm I used in the past ?

### Answers
- microcosms store data locally and sync data between peoples devices, this local storage is in the browser and is not stored forever, in some cases the browser will delete this storage within 7 days (most are longer but). You can reset this 7 day timer by visiting the top level domain of the instant of nodenogg.in you used for example https://nodenogg.in


## Q: I deleted my browsers "Site Data" and now I can't see my microcosm ?

### Answers
- You have deleted the local storage on your device which will have deleted the microcosm data, you cant get this back unless someone else you worked with still has the data and is able to re-sync with you by you both joining the same microcosm again.

## Q: Could someone else see my nodes and data without my knowledge ?

### Answers
- Technically yes, if someone visits the same nodenogg.in instance as you say the hosted version at https://nodenogg.in at the same time and happens to type in the same microcosm name as you they will join the same place. It is recommended to use a microcosm name thats easy but also to think about how you can make it unique to mitigate against this possible issue.
