# Why nodenoggin over other edtech such as Padlet, Etherpad, Vevox or even Microsoft Wordâ€¦to gather ideas together?

nodenogg.in is designed with data and ethical privacy at its heart, it has no idea who you are, which contributions are yours, what device you own or where you are.

Use nodenogg.infor studio/classroom/community brainstorming, idea generation, feedback, crits and social note taking with ease and data protection at the forefront. [Detailed example scenerios](scenerios) 

By using nodenogg.in to think as a team, we are asking you to share your ideas via networked technology, so nodenogg.in does NOT store anything on a server, nodenogg.in syncs ideas between participants (peer to peer) directly and only during that session.

Using nodenogg.in encourages wider participation of ideas, everyone's contribution has equally weight as it is not identifiable to anyone (unless you identify yourself!).

nodenogg.in is designed to supplement and enhance in person (real-time) team (Communities of Practice) activities extending social learning spaces.

nodenogg.in is for teams of people, to think and learn privately together.
