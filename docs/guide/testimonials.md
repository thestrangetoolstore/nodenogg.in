## General

> I don’t think I’ve ever seen edtech software created in such close dialogue with its intended audience, or so unambiguously created with respect and care for pedagogy.

## Crits

> nodenogg.in proved very effective, we found that the number of students participating increased substantially. It was now the majority of people in the room who would leave feedback, and the nature of the comments left for those presenting was also a lot more liberal.

> Students commented on the fact that they had felt self-conscious during conversations in class, often worrying about being judged on either the questions they’d ask, or the feedback they’d give. Many commented on how nodenogg.in was a great solution.

> Students said that nodenogg.in helped encourage conversation, they often felt more inclined to discuss their projects in the studios after using nodenogg.in.

> With nodenogg.in being anonymous it was seen by students as an ideal method to be a critical friend, they commented how much the feedback would help them in their own project work.

> The feedback in nodenogg.in lead to further examination of their own projects and triggering further improvements.

## Live Feedback

> As hand in loomed the students seemed happy and understood what was expected, but as soon as I used nodenogg.in it became clear that was not the case! **We cleared up a lot overarching concerns, reduced anxiety, and a bunch of queries we would never have caught without nodenogg.in.**

## Curriclum Interventions


> we had access to an AGENT prototype feature called SleepeR which enabled you to ingest a small set of reading list texts and used a range of ways to compare nodenogg.in notes to surface extracts from the reading list. **Students really engaged directly with the reading lists via conversations captured in the sessions microcosm's.**

## International Students

>I was struggling in seminars to get discussion with my students who don't speak English as a first language. I prepared a line of questions based on my lecture notes and the reading and arranged them on the nodenogg.in microcosm for students to respond to as information was presented. I'd ask a question and give them 1-2 minutes to respond. It was the first time I got what felt like a real sense of how well the students were tracking along with the content, and where they had questions. **I got nearly 100% engagement when I normally average around 20%**


> For the last few years my students have been overwhelmingly international students, most of whom have only limited proficiency in English and often find it hard to intervene in class. Introducing nodenogg.in in the classroom has re-energised the classroom experience with a lot more communication coming forward through the screen. This has allowed us to get a sense of where we are all at and re-introduce more active moments into the lessons. The anonymous nature of nodenogg.in means that students are often more daring, both in the opinions they express and in bringing humour into their interventions, which is very welcome. The ability to use icons to agree with others is also a really good way of getting a sense of where consensus, dissensus or priorities lie. **Finally, it is very reassuring to know – given the open nature of classroom discussions – that nodenogg.in will not be mining students’ data.**
